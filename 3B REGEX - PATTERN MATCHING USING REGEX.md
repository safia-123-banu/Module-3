## REGEX - PATTERN MATCHING USING REGEX

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that matches a string containing an `'a'` followed by **two to three `'b'` characters** using regular expressions.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Accept a string `str1` from the user.  
3. Define the regular expression pattern as `r"[a]+b{2,3}"`.  
4. Use the `re.match()` function to check if the string `str1` matches the pattern.  
5. If a match is found, print `"Found a match!"`.  
6. If no match is found, print `"Not matched!"`.  
7. Terminate the program.

---

### PROGRAM

```
import re
pattern= r"a.*b$"
input_string = input()
if re.fullmatch(pattern, input_string):
print("Found a match!")
else:
print("Not matched!")
```

### RESULT
Thus the Python program to match a string with 'a' followed by 2 to 3 'b' characters using regular expressions was executed successfully.
